/**
 * What a package declares before any of its code is allowed to supply an exchange rate.
 *
 * Core ships no rate table, no rate feed and no rate policy, so every rate in a Kumwe installation
 * arrives from a package that said in its signed manifest that it would supply one. The declaration is
 * what makes that inspectable before install: an operator can read which currencies a package claims to
 * price and where it sits in the resolution order, without running it. An external rate service, a
 * manually administered table, a bank feed and a contractual fixed rate all declare through this same
 * shape.
 *
 * The currency list is a closed claim, not a hint. A conversion whose source or target currency is
 * outside it is not offered to that provider at all, so a package cannot quietly widen its reach after
 * admission by changing its runtime behaviour.
